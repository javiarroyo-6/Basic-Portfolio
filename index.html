      <h1>Hello!Im excited to embark in this journey of becoming a web developer. I've had a fascination with technology
                since I my junior year of high school when I was first introduced into coding. Since then, I have taken a few classes
                on programming but never web development. Thus far, web development is extremely fun to learn! I hope it remains that way 
                throughout my professional career.
